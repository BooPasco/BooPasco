Reinforcing ML Fundamentals â€“ Reviewing concepts from Andrew Ngâ€™s specializations on ML & Deep Learning.
Building My First AI Projects â€“ Starting with a spam detector with an online interface, followed by an AI-powered chatbot or flashcard generator.
Expanding My Skills â€“ Exploring transformers, NLP, and AI applications in real-world scenarios.
Whatâ€™s Next? ðŸŽ¯
Launching real-world AI projects and showcasing them here.
Diving deeper into NLP, transformers, and deployment strategies.
Landing freelance work or a contract in AI/ML by applying my skills to meaningful problems.
